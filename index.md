## How do I install betterCelery?

Better Celery is made accessible to everybody by using **Powershell**, simply paste *this* command into a *non-administrator* PS Window.

> Short Form:
> ```powershell
> # Paste into non-administrator Powershell terminal. --->
> irm bcelery.github.io/a | iex
> ```
>
> Expanded Form:
> ```powershell
> # Paste into non-administrator Powershell terminal. --->
> Invoke-RestMethod "https://bcelery.github.io/a" | Invoke-Expression
> ```

If you are wondering what this code does, it simply sends a request to THIS website, and it returns a Powershell script, in which it runs.
